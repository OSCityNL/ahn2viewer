# ahn2viewer

Simple but quick viewer for pointclouds in XYZ text format. Using GL VBO 10M points without any performance hit. 
Nice for playing with Dutch AHN2 dataset.

Usage:
* Download and install a IDE. I used free and open source Code::Blocks http://www.codeblocks.org/
* Download and install OpenFrameworks lib: http://openframeworks.cc/
* Open the .workspace file in repository in CodeBlocks
* Compile and run

It should look like this: http://oscity.eu/projects/ahn2-testrun/

* a test XYZ pointcloud file is located in the bin/data directory (thanks to Eugene Tjoa, tjoadesign.nl)
* you can download LAZ files of you favorite part of the Netherlands via the AHN2 Website:  http://www.ahn.nl/index.html
* convert from LAZ to XYZ with LasTools: http://www.cs.unc.edu/~isenburg/lastools/
